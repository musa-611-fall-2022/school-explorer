# School Explorer Product Requirements Document

## Who is it for (users):

* Parents (or students) deciding between which schools to choose
* Educational advocates to determine where to target their efforts and resources?
* School administrators evaluating their own school against others?

## Why do they need it (users' problems and goals):

There are hundreds of schools throughout the district and parents and students may not know all of their options.Likewise, it can be difficult to keep up with changes in the process of applying to schools for even the most plugged-in parents.

**Parents (or students) want clear guidance about schools, to make sure that they can choose a school that's going to give their student (or themselves) the best opportunities to excel, coupled with the best alignment with their interests.**

Choosing a school can be a long process. Initially, there is a lot of exploring of the space: what are my neighborhood schools? What are the schools I can apply to outside of my neighborhood.选择学校可能是一个漫长的过程。 最初，对该空间进行了很多探索：我附近的学校有哪些？ 我可以申请我所在社区以外的哪些学校。

Once they have an idea of the general landscape, the may start to ask bigger questions (e.g., if I wanted to be in the catchment for school X, how much would it cost to live there?).一旦他们了解了总体情况，他们可能会开始提出更大的问题（例如，如果我想住在 X 学校的学区内，住在那里要花多少钱？）。

Finally, at the point where they have an idea of what schools they should target, they have to find the criteria for and navigate the process of gaining admission to those schools.最后，当他们知道他们应该瞄准哪些学校时，他们必须找到这些学校的录取标准并引导这些学校的录取过程。
